These assignments are from the "Machine Learning Specialization" course offered by Coursera.org, in partnership with Stanford and DeepLearning.ai. It provides a hands-on experience in building different Machine Learning models and applying them to real-life applications.  
Linear Regression: Linear Regression implementation 
Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression implementation 
Decision_Tree_with_Markdown: Decision Tree implementation for classification 
DNN_Classification: Building NN for handwritten digit classification 
Anomaly_Detection:  Implementing anomaly detection algorithm to detect failing servers on a network
KMeans: Implementing K-Means algorithm for data compression
Collaborative_Filtering:  Implement collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies
Content_Based_Filtering: Implementing content-based filtering using a neural network to build a recommender system for movies
Reinforcement_Learning:  Training an agent to land a lunar lander safely on a landing pad on the surface of the moon using deep Q-learning
